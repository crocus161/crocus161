# Hi there, I'm Danial - aka [crocus161]👋

I'm a passionate frontend developer from Ukraine (Odessa, Kropivnitskiy) with a keen interest in creating intuitive and dynamic web applications. I have a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and TypeScript, I specialize in building responsive and user-friendly interfaces.

## Experience and Projects 🧐
I have a deep understanding and hands-on experience with a wide range of tools and technologies in the external development ecosystem. Most of all possible tools have already been studied by me or are in my plans for further growth.

I have been actively working on various projects that demonstrate my proficiency in modern frontend technologies. Currently, I am working on a [Google Translator Clone](https://translator--copy.web.app/text) which showcases my ability to implement complex features and deliver seamless user experiences. Additionally, I have completed numerous projects involving React, Redux, Mobx and other state management libraries, showcasing my ability to handle large-scale applications.

## Personal Interests and Motivations 😌
My web development journey started in school with a fascination with how websites work and the endless possibilities they offer. I am particularly motivated by the challenge of creating apps that not only meet user needs, but also provide a great experience. I like to create clones of popular big platforms, native apps or small functional pages, which often inspires me and supports my creativity.
